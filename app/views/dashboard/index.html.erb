      <div class='sub-title inner'>An ex-convict's journey to and through Silicon Valley</div>
      <div class='overview inner'>I am the chief technology officer of a multi million pound (Â£) business in London.
        Before accepting my role here, I built a $1.1 billion dollar company in San Francisco. Before that I worked for
        the federal government of the United States. I've travelled the world. I've married the woman of my dreams,
        made enough money to retire at the age of 30. But before all this, I was convicted of a felony when I was 18.
        The crime? I put my father in a coma.

        After prison this left me homeless, unemployed, uneducated in the vast plains of scarce opportunities in
        Oklahoma, in debt $17000 to the Department of Corrections, and inches away from going to prison again. This
        time for ten years.

        This story is about rebuilding, about completely changing my situation over the course of a decade. It's about
        learning to lead by example.
